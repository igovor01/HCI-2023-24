# Class Project 8: Reading progress feature and informative feedback with React-Toastify

## What We Accomplished:

- Users now receive informative feedback with React-Toastify, a library enabling customizable notifications in our app.
- Users can now set reading progress for books they are currently reading.

## Challenges Encountered:

- Some images in the Benefits section are not displaying as intended.
- The reading progress feature requires further refinement.

## What's Next:

### Addressing Current Issues:

- Resolving image display issues within the Benefits section.
- Improving the reading progress feature by allowing users to input the number of pages read, thereby calculating the reading progress percentage with the provided information.

### Future Enhancements:
