# Class Project 7: Authentication with NextAuth

## What We Accomplished:

- Users can now sign in and sign up in our application: [https://github.com/ikojun00/HCI-2023-24/tree/auth].
- Backend implementation can be found in the following location: [https://github.com/ikojun00/Book-Voyage-API].
- Live preview: [https://hci-2023-24-git-auth-ivors-projects.vercel.app/]

## Challenges Encountered:

- The application currently lacks feedback for unsuccessful logins, making it difficult for users to understand what went wrong.

## What's Next:

### Addressing Current Issues:

- Enhance the user experience by providing informative feedback for unsuccessful login attempts.

### Future Enhancements:

- Implement a reviews feature for books to allow users to share their thoughts and ratings.
- Develop a user bookshelf functionality to enable users to manage their reading lists effectively.
